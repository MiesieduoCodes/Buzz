## 🎯 Core Features

Buzz introduces modern messaging primitives while adding emotional & gamified layers. Ship fast, delight users, and iterate.

### 🌟 Vibes
Send micro-emotional pulses (color + haptics + sound) instead of plain text.

### 🔗 Pollination Chains  
Daily streaks between friends that earn Nectar and visual honey trails.

### 🎵 Audio Realms
Drop-in group audio with reactive visuals and voice filters.

### ⚡ Buzz Moments
Mood-reactive ephemeral posts that morph over time.

### 🏠 Hive System
Small social groups with shared energy, leaderboards & collective rewards.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
End-to-end encryption options, ephemeral whispers, biometric locks.

## 🎨 UX & Visual Language

Buzz uses hexagonal grids, soft animations and a warm golden palette. Interactions are tactile: haptic buzzes, micro-animations and sound cues.

- **Design tokens** - Color palette, spacing, motion scale, and typography
- **Micro-interactions** - Animated send, vibe pulses, honey drips on streaks  
- **Accessibility** - High-contrast mode, reduced-motion option, and screen-reader-friendly labels

## 🏗️ Backend Architecture

Firebase powers Buzz with Firestore for chat and metadata, RTDB for presence, Storage for media, Auth for sign-in and Cloud Functions for glue logic.

### 🔥 Realtime
Listeners, optimized queries, offline sync, and pagination.

### ⚡ Serverless  
Cloud Functions for score calc, moderation, push triggers, and scheduled tasks.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Iterative phases to ship quickly and expand features with metrics-driven decisions.

### Phase 1 (MVP)

### Phase 2

### Phase 3
